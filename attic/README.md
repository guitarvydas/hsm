Hierachical State Machines

Much like Harel StateCharts, but without orthogonal states.

This simple example shows a Lamp sub-divided into 3 sub-parts:
1. Lamp
2. Brightness
3. Colour

The Lamp has 3 toggle buttons,
1. On/Off ("power", "pwr")
2. Brightness (low, mid, high)
3. Colour (yellow, green, red)

There are 2 kinds of Components:
1. Leaf
2. Container

Usage:
- python3 test.py
- python3 testsingle.py

See:
hsm.drawio tab "Lamp"
hsm.drawio tab "Lamp Tester"

code:
Lamp.py
- brightness.py
-- colour.py
